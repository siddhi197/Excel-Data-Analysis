# Excel-Data-Mining: Chair Sales Analysis

This Excel project involves analyzing a dataset of chair sales over two quarters (Q1 and Q2) using various Excel functions and techniques, including VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, and Conditional Formulas. The goal was to clean, transform, and analyze sales data to generate insights.

Key Steps and Features:
Dataset: The data includes details on chair sales for Q1 and Q2, with information such as customer IDs, chair models, quantities sold, and total price.
Discount Calculation: A new column, "Final Price," was created by applying a 5% discount on the total price when more than 20 chairs were sold in a transaction.
VLOOKUP: Used to link the Company Name and Representative Name to each sale based on the Customer ID, enhancing the dataset with additional context.
Pivot Table Analysis: A pivot table was generated to summarize the total number of chairs sold per month and model, providing insights into sales trends and performance.

Tools & Techniques:
Excel Functions: VLOOKUP, IF, SUMIF
Pivot Tables and Charts
Data Transformation and Conditional Logic

This project demonstrates how Excel can be used for data mining, transforming raw sales data into actionable insights, while practicing key Excel techniques like lookup functions and pivot table analysis.
